By the way, some notes on zero-copy ... You might want to have NAPI drivers [1]
enabled in your kernel to reduce interrupt load and for high-speed (= relative
to the CPU speed) PCAP dumping and replay, a fast SSD isn't too bad either,
and make sure to use netsniff-ngs scatter/gather or mmap I/O options. Next to
this, (and this refers to packet generation as well), a 10-Gbit/s-Ethernet
NIC, an appropriate amount of RAM and a fast CPU is recommended. Furthermore,
you should bind the netsniff-ng tools to a specific CPU via commandline option
(i.e. --bind-cpu 0). Some further recommendations can be found in [2] [4]. Also,
Eric Dumazets BPF Just-in-Time compiler can speed up the critical path [3].
