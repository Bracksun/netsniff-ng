Things to note when using netsniff-ng:
//////////////////////////////////////

If not otherwise specified, netsniff-ng tries to get a good performance on
default. For instance, this includes things like tuning the system's socket
memory, enabling the BPF JIT compiler, migrating the NIC's interrupt affinity
and so on. If you don't want netsniff-ng to do this, look at the relevant cmd
line options that disable them with ``--help'' and explicitly specify them on
the program start.
