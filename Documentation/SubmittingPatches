Checklist for Patches:
//////////////////////

Submitting patches should follow this guideline (derived from the Git project):

* Commits:

- make sure to comply with the coding guidelines (see CodingStyle)
- make commits of logical units
- check for unnecessary whitespace with "git diff --check" before committing
- do not check in commented out code or unneeded files
- the first line of the commit message should be a short description (50
  characters is the soft limit, see DISCUSSION in git-commit(1)), and should
  skip the full stop
- the body should provide a meaningful commit message, which:
  . explains the problem the change tries to solve, iow, what is wrong with
    the current code without the change.
  . justifies the way the change solves the problem, iow, why the result with
    the change is better.
  . alternate solutions considered but discarded, if any.
- describe changes in imperative mood, e.g. "make xyzzy do frotz" instead of
  "[This patch] makes xyzzy do frotz" or "[I] changed xyzzy to do frotz", as
  if you are giving orders to the codebase to change its behaviour.
- try to make sure your explanation can be understood without external
  resources. Instead of giving a URL to a mailing list archive, summarize the
  relevant points of the discussion.
- add a "Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>" line to the commit message
  (or just use the option "-s" when committing) to confirm that you agree to
  the Developer's Certificate of Origin (see also
  http://linux.yyz.us/patch-format.html)
- make sure syntax of man-pages is free of errors: podchecker <tool>.c

* For Patches via GitHub:

- fork the netsniff-ng project on GitHub to your local GitHub account
  (https://github.com/gnumaniacs/netsniff-ng)
- make your changes to the latest master branch with respect to the commit
  section above
- if you change, add, or remove a command line option or make some other user
  interface change, the associated documentation should be updated as well.
- open a pull request on (https://github.com/gnumaniacs/netsniff-ng) and send
  a notification to the list (netsniff-ng@googlegroups.com) and the maintainer
  (bugs@netsniff-ng.org) if (and only if) the patch is ready for inclusion.
- if your name is not writable in ASCII, make sure that you send off a message
  in the correct encoding.
- add a short description what the patch or patchset is about

* For Patches via Mail:

- use "git format-patch -M" to create the patch
- do not PGP sign your patch
- do not attach your patch, but read in the mail body, unless you cannot teach
  your mailer to leave the formatting of the patch alone.
- be careful doing cut & paste into your mailer, not to corrupt whitespaces.
- provide additional information (which is unsuitable for the commit message)
  between the "---" and the diffstat
- if you change, add, or remove a command line option or make some other user
  interface change, the associated documentation should be updated as well.
- if your name is not writable in ASCII, make sure that you send off a message
  in the correct encoding.
- send the patch to the list (netsniff-ng@googlegroups.com) and the maintainer
  (bugs@netsniff-ng.org) if (and only if) the patch is ready for inclusion.
  If you use git-send-email(1), please test it first by sending email to
  yourself.
