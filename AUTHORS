Notes:

The order of authors with > 30 commits listed here is sorted by contributions
from high to low through ``git log --no-merges $@ | grep Author: | \
cut -d: -f2 | cut -d\< -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r''. The list of minor
contributors is currently unsorted and contains people who have contributed
code ``in some way'' (e.g. on the upstream or maintenance repositories), either
through Git or email.

Note that we have taken over the maintenance and further development of Herbert
Haas' mausezahn utility after he passed away in 2011. There were no Git commit
statistics available from the import of his project. (*)

Want to join the core team? Submit enough great patches over a long time,
implement what's on the TODO file and show an ongoing, active interest in
supporting netsniff-ng. What's in for you? If you ever come to Switzerland,
you get a free beer on Daniel and you can meet some great people involved in
this project. ;)
