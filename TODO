Here's a list of things we need to do (contributions are welcome and highly
appreciated, please also read Documentation/SubmittingPatches about how to
submit your contributions):

 0) Improve manpages, extend the documentation or write useful howtos.
 1) Highest prio: Cleanup and refactor the code and build system to make it
    more maintainable, stable, and probably faster! mausezahn: clean it up
    add fork + fanout mode, remove libpcap dependency, let it also store
    pcap files e.g. on a network filesystem of the mausezahn box.
 3) Add full IPv6 support for flowtop, test IPv6 on curvetun.
 5) Make trafgen also write to a pcap instead to a device.
 6) Let netsniff-ng and trafgen support pcap and pcap-ng!
10) Add a proper 802.11 dissector for netsniff-ng.
12) Add new dissectors (e.g. BGP, DNS, DCCP, SCTP, RSVP, IPsec, LISP, RADIUS,
    LLC, fix MPLS?, improve ARP, BPDU, PVST, CDP, LLDP, RTP, Syslog, NTP,
    OpenFlow, ...), add new protocols to mausezahn.
13) Easier language for /fast/ filtering (e.g. on top of BPF so that it can run
    in the kernel), include this into bpfc.
16) Further micro-optimize netsniff-ng, trafgen, mausezahn's performance. Use
    Oprofile for optimize tools!
17) Security review of curvetun.
21) Obfuscate curvetun's protocol to make it hard/resource-intensive for DPIs.
22) Add different timing models to trafgen, not just a static interpacket gap.
24) Do we need TPACKETV2 or even TPACKETV3 if it is eventually implemented?
25) Do performance tests with 10 Gigabit cards.
28) Remove liburcu dependency from flowtop.
29) Improve the Linux kernel's net/packet/af_packet.c (that we rely on)
30) Fix UDP+TCP tracking in flowtop.
31) astraceroute: implement DNS traceroute with AS/Geo information
32) ifpps: add option for --dev eth0,eth1,eth2 and accumulate stats
33) flowtop: can we get per socket pps, bytes per sec without sniffing?
34) Are there other interesting (e.g. ethtool) stats for ifpps?
