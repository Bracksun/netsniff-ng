Here's a list of things we need to do (contributions are welcome and highly
appreciated, please also read Documentation/SubmittingPatches about how to
submit your contributions):

 0) Improve manpages, extend the documentation or write useful howtos.
 1) Highest prio: Cleanup and refactor the code and build system to make it
    more maintainable, stable, and probably faster!
 2) Implement test cases with libtap (src/test/). Make the output readable
    (currently cmake hides it all).
 3) Add full IPv6 support for flowtop, test IPv6 on curvetun.
 5) Make trafgen also write to a pcap instead to a device.
 6) Let netsniff-ng and trafgen support pcap and pcap-ng!
 7) Include an ARP cache poisoning tool.
 8) integrate Mausezahn: maintain it, clean it up, add fork + fanout mode for
    a threaded "netsniff-ng and trafgen" front-end with Cisco-cli for a hw/sw
    applicance. Only leave interactive mode.
10) Add a proper 802.11 dissector for netsniff-ng.
12) Add new dissectors (e.g. BGP, DNS, DCCP, SCTP, RSVP, IPsec, LISP, RADIUS,
    LLC, fix MPLS?, improve ARP, BPDU, PVST, CDP, LLDP, RTP, Syslog, NTP,
    OpenFlow, ...).
13) Easier language for /fast/ filtering (e.g. on top of BPF so that it can run
    in the kernel), include this into bpfc.
14) Add timedb for ifpps, so that we have round robin time series database
    measurements (https://github.com/EPiCS/reconos/tree/master/linux/tools/timedb).
16) Further micro-optimize netsniff-ng and trafgen's performance.
17) Security review of curvetun.
21) Obfuscate curvetun's protocol to make it hard/resource-intensive for DPIs.
22) Add different timing models to trafgen, not just a static interpacket gap.
24) Do we need TPACKETV2 or even TPACKETV3 if it is eventually implemented?
25) Do performance tests with 10 Gigabit cards.
27) Integration of our repository with Travis-CI
28) Remove liburcu dependency from flowtop
29) Improve the Linux kernel's net/packet/af_packet.c (that we rely on)
30) Fix UDP+TCP tracking in flowtop.
31) astraceroute: implement DNS traceroute with AS/Geo information
